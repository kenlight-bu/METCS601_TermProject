## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a professional portfolio website that showcases my skills, experience, and projects as a software developer. This website serves as a digital resume and a personal brand statement, allowing potential employers, clients, and collaborators to learn more about my expertise and view examples of my work.

Through this project, I aim to:

- Demonstrate my mastery of modern web development technologies, including **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **React**.
- Apply principles of **responsive design** and **usability** to create an engaging user experience across all devices.
- Highlight my ability to integrate advanced features, such as drag-and-drop functionality, SVG creation, and API/database connections.
- Provide an organized, visually appealing platform to showcase my biography, resume, skills, and project portfolio.

Ultimately, this portfolio is a reflection of my growth as a developer and a tool to connect with opportunities that align with my passion for building innovative software solutions.
